## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to go from raw data to actionable insights using:

- **Data Preprocessing** with pandas
- **Machine Learning** with XGBoost
- **Explainability** with SHAP
- **Visualization** with Streamlit
- **KPI Analysis** with SQL simulations

## üîÅ Execution Pipeline

### Preprocessing:
`src/data_processing.py` cleans the dataset and saves it as `data/processed/cleaned_data.csv`.

### Model Training:
`src/model_training.py` trains an XGBoost model, evaluates it using metrics, and saves the trained model.

### SHAP Explainability:
`src/shap_explainer.py` generates a feature importance plot based on SHAP values.

### Interactive Dashboard:
`dashboard/app.py` displays metrics and predictions in an interactive interface built with Streamlit.

### Simulated SQL Queries:
`sql/kpi_queries.sql` contains sample queries for KPI analysis, such as conversion rate and visitor behavior.
